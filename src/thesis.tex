\chapter{Figures} \label{chap:figs}

You can put your figures in the path \texttt{./figures/} and reference them from
there. For example, this adorable cat is saved as \texttt{./figures/floof-wizard.png}. You can include the picture with the following code:
\begin{minted}{latex}
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{floof-wizard}
  %                 no ./figures needed ^
  \caption{This is Walter!}
\end{figure}
\end{minted}
to get the following figure:
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=0.3\textheight]{floof-wizard}
  \caption{This is (an internet orang car) Walter!}
\end{figure}
